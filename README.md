# R2Convex
Construct convex hull in 2d and draw pictures of convex hulls and their intersections

## Requirements
You need to have only C++ compiler, no external dependencies

## Install
```sh
git clone https://github.com/DavidOSX/R2Convex.git
cd R2Convex
make
```

## Usage
Just run: ```./conv```
Program read coordinates of points from files: ```data.txt```, ```data1.txt```, ```data2.txt```.
Draw convex hulls of these points and draw their intersections in ```bmp``` format.
