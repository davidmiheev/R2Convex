# R2Convex
Construct convex hull in 2d and draw pictures of convex hulls and their intersections

## Requirements
You need to have only C++ compiler, no external dependencies

## Install
```sh
git clone https://github.com/davidmiheev/R2Convex.git
cd R2Convex
make
```

## Usage
Just run: ```./conv```


The program reads the coordinates of points from files: ```data.txt```, ```data1.txt```, ```data2.txt```;
and draws convex hulls of these points and their intersections in [bmp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format) format.
